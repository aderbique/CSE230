# Exercises 

## Exercise 1 (2pts)
### Prompt
Perform a multiplication of two binary numbers (multiplicand 0110 and multiplier 0110) by creating a table to show steps taken, multiplicand register value, multiplier register value, and product register value for each iteration by following the steps described in the following document. (Points will be deducted if steps are not shown.)

### Response

## Exercise 2 (2pts)
### Prompt
Perform a division of two binary numbers (divide 0011 0110 by 0110) by creating a table to show steps taken, quotient register value, divisor register value, and remainder register value for each iteration by following the steps described in the following document. (Points will be deducted if steps are now shown.)

### Reponse

## Exercise 5 (2pts)
### Prompt
What would the number `18653.4140625` base ten be in IEEE 754 single precision floating point format? You need to follow the following steps:
1. Write the above number in binary. (before normalizing it)
2. Write the above number in the normalized format.
3. Compute the biased exponent, and write it in binary.
4. Write its IEEE 754 single precision floating point format in binary, then in hex. (using 8 hex numbers)

### Response

## Exercise 6 (2pts)
### Prompt
What would the number `-18472.40625` base ten be in IEEE 754 single precision floating point format?
1. Write the above number in binary. (before normalizing it)  
2. Write the above number in the normalized format.   
3. Compute the biased exponent, and write it in binary. 
4. Write its IEEE 754 single precision floating point format in binary, then in hex. (using 8 hex numbers)

### Repsonse

## Exercise 7 (2pts)
### Prompt
What decimal number would be the IEEE 754 single precision floating point number `0xC5A3B760` be? Write your final answer in scientific notation as `m x 10^p` where `p` is an integer.

### Response

## Exercise 8 (2pts)
### Prompt
For this problem, assume 5 bits precision. Add two binary numbers, `1.0011 base two x 2^(-8)` and `1.0101 base two x 2^(-6)` showing the following steps:
1. Adding the exponent without bias.
2. Multiply the significands. (You can assume that you can carry all digits)
3. Normalize the product and check for an overflow or an underflow.
4. Truncate the product (using 5 bits precision.)

### Reponse

## Exercise 9 (2pts)
### Prompt
Add `8.96 base ten x 10^10` to `6.78 base ten x 10^8`, assuming the following two different ways:
1. You have only three significant digits, first with guard (2 digits) and round digits.
2. You have only three significant digits without guard and rounding.
