# MIPS Hello World

##Objectives
This assignment is for you to become familiar with the QTSpim simulator that we will be using in this course. You can use a machine in BYENG 214 (a computer lab) or install the QTSpim into your own computer, by downloading from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/  (Links to an external site.)

You will edit an assembly language program, load it in the QTSpim, execute it, and step through the program.
